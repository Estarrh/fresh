    <p>I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.
        2 My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.
        3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.
        4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
        5 The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.</p>
